# HUEston
A small GUI for accessing Philips HUE Lamps under any Windows environment.

## Currently Working

* Setup and pairing with your HUE Bridge (config will be saved)
* Autodetection of your HUE Bridge by using Philips nupnp service
* Control of your lamps per room 

## Things to come

* Individual control of every lamp
* Presets for moods or stuff like that (including config writer)
* Room-View Mode (getting, display and modify states per Room under Rooms)
* Lamp-Mode ((getting, display and modify states per Lamp under Lamps)

## Issues or untested Things

Since I don't own any old HUE Hardware (newest Bridge and RGB Lamps only) I can't tell if there will be any bug with older Bridges or Lamps. However, if you're using the same Hardware as I do, you should be fine. Feel free to report any bug.
