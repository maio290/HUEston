# HUEston
A small GUI for accessing Philips HUE Lamps under any Windows environment.

## Currently Working

* Setup and pairing with your HUE Bridge (config will be saved)
* Autodetection of your HUE Bridge by using Philips nupnp service
* Control of your lamps per room
* Control of each lamp individually

## Things to come
* Presets for moods or stuff like that (including config writer)
* Current colour display 
* New GUI

## Issues or untested Things

Since I don't own any old HUE Hardware (newest Bridge and RGB Lamps only) I can't tell if there will be any bug with older Bridges or Lamps. However, if you're using the same Hardware as I do, you should be fine. Feel free to report any bug.
